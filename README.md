# Libary_Datebase Example Project using MYSQL Server

## My choice for this particular project stems from curiosity on how I could design a database for Libary use

This project is an example that was built along with YouTube and other source channels showing how to create a Libary database:

* At first I designed my sketched ER diagram to enable brainstorming on what entity and attributes will be required for a Libary database management system
* Afterwards create the database, the tables, their attributes, and data types.
* Inserted the values accordingly
* Then I identified the primary keys and foreign keys by using constraints to form a relationship.

## The project tends to solve the problem of data quality, data integrity, and management of both people and books

* With this project in place, books can be allocated properly, users can be identified, and tracking of performance will be easy
* Furthermore it helps promote accountability

## This is just a simple use of the Data Definition Language in SQL, and the Data Manipulation Language syntax in MYSQL
* It is an unfinished project as I look forward to advancing and improving my skill set
* The information inputted in the project is manipulated for the sake of this project's example

## How to tweak this project for your use

* Since this is an example project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to suit your own purposes.
